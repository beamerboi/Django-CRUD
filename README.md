# Django-CRUD
This is saved for upcoming projects, I used Class Based Views and DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK API Generics to build this CRUD.
The documentation I used is linked here -> https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/.
This will be a time saving for later on and for upcoming project.. please use it as an initial template and customize it the way you want ðŸš€.
